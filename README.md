# claude-timed

Track how time is spent during Claude Code sessions: how long you're idle after the agent finishes, how long you spend typing, and how long the agent works.

## How it works

`claude-timed` is a Node.js PTY wrapper that sits between your terminal and the `claude` process. It uses two mechanisms to track timing:

1. **Keystroke interception** — The wrapper intercepts stdin in raw mode to detect when you start typing (only real text input — arrow keys, Ctrl combos, Tab, etc. are ignored).
2. **Claude Code hooks** — Two [hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) drive transitions:
   - **UserPromptSubmit** — Fires when the user actually submits a prompt. Writes a timestamp to a temp file so the wrapper knows when the agent started working.
   - **Stop** — Fires when the agent finishes responding. Writes a timestamp so the wrapper knows when the agent completed.

These signals drive a state machine:

```
INITIAL  --(first keystroke)---------> typing started
         --(UserPromptSubmit hook)---> AGENT_WORKING

AGENT_WORKING --(Stop hook)----------> IDLE

IDLE --(first keystroke)--------------> USER_TYPING

USER_TYPING --(UserPromptSubmit hook)-> AGENT_WORKING
```

Shift+Enter (multi-line input) is handled correctly: the `UserPromptSubmit` hook only fires on actual prompt submission, not on newline insertion. This works regardless of terminal capabilities.

Each transition is logged to a per-session JSONL file in `~/.claude/timings/`.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **Claude Code** CLI (`claude`) installed and on your PATH
- A C/C++ toolchain for compiling `node-pty` (build-essential / Xcode CLI tools)

## Installation

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd claude_timings_wrapper
npm install
```

### Install the hooks

This adds Stop and UserPromptSubmit hook entries to `~/.claude/settings.json` and copies the hook scripts to `~/.claude/hooks/`. Your existing settings (other hooks, plugins, statusLine, etc.) are preserved. A `.timing-bak` backup is created before any modification.

```bash
node bin/claude-timed.mjs --install-hook
```

### Optional: make it globally available

```bash
npm link
```

Then you can use `claude-timed` from anywhere instead of `node bin/claude-timed.mjs`.

## Usage

### Start a timed session

```bash
claude-timed
# or with arguments passed through to claude:
claude-timed --model sonnet
```

The terminal title bar shows a live timer indicating the current phase (Idle, Typing, or Agent).

All Claude Code functionality works exactly as normal — the wrapper is transparent.

### View stats

```bash
claude-timed --stats                          # Current/most recent session
claude-timed --stats today                    # Today's sessions
claude-timed --stats week                     # Last 7 days
claude-timed --stats month                    # Last 30 days
claude-timed --stats 2026-03-01               # Since a specific date
claude-timed --stats 2026-03-01 2026-03-11    # Custom date range
claude-timed --stats all                      # All sessions
```

Example output:

```
=== Claude Code Timing Stats ===
Period: Today (2026-03-11)
Sessions: 3 | Prompts: 22

             Total        Average/prompt
  User:      12m 30s      34.1s
    Idle:    8m 15s       22.5s
    Typing:  4m 15s       11.6s
  Agent:     1h 5m        2m 58s

Time distribution:
  User:  16.1%  ███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
  Agent: 83.9%  █████████████████░░░
```

### Uninstall the hooks

Removes timing hooks from settings and deletes the hook scripts. Other settings are untouched.

```bash
claude-timed --uninstall-hook
```

### Help

```bash
claude-timed --timing-help
```

## Completion sound (optional)

When the agent finishes and is waiting for your input, `claude-timed` can play a short notification sound (`complete.mp3` in the project root). This is entirely optional — if the sound file is missing or no supported player is installed, no sound plays and no errors are shown.

### Native Linux

Install any one of the following MP3-capable players:

| Player | Install (Debian/Ubuntu) | Install (Fedora) | Install (Arch) |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `mpv` (recommended) | `sudo apt install mpv` | `sudo dnf install mpv` | `sudo pacman -S mpv` |
| `mpg123` | `sudo apt install mpg123` | `sudo dnf install mpg123` | `sudo pacman -S mpg123` |
| `mpg321` | `sudo apt install mpg321` | — | — |
| `ffplay` (part of ffmpeg) | `sudo apt install ffmpeg` | `sudo dnf install ffmpeg` | `sudo pacman -S ffmpeg` |

The first available player from the list above is used. Detection happens once on the first agent completion.

### WSL2

If none of the native Linux players above are installed, the wrapper falls back to PowerShell's `System.Windows.Media.MediaPlayer`, which is available out of the box on any WSL2 system with access to `powershell.exe`. No additional Windows-side installation is required.

If you prefer lower latency, install one of the native Linux players listed above. With [WSLg](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg) (enabled by default on Windows 11), native Linux audio works transparently inside WSL2.

## Data storage

Session data is stored as JSONL files in `~/.claude/timings/`:

```
~/.claude/timings/
├── 2026-03-11T10-30-00_a1b2c3d4.jsonl
├── 2026-03-11T14-15-22_d4e5f6a7.jsonl
└── ...
```

Each file contains one JSON object per line:

```jsonl
{"ts":"...","event":"session_start","session":"a1b2c3d4"}
{"ts":"...","event":"prompt_submit","prompt":1,"typing_ms":5230}
{"ts":"...","event":"agent_stop","prompt":1,"agent_work_ms":45000}
{"ts":"...","event":"typing_start","prompt":2,"idle_ms":30000}
{"ts":"...","event":"prompt_submit","prompt":2,"typing_ms":10000}
{"ts":"...","event":"agent_stop","prompt":2,"agent_work_ms":35000}
{"ts":"...","event":"session_end","total_user_ms":45230,"total_idle_ms":30000,"total_typing_ms":15230,"total_agent_ms":80000,"prompts":2}
```

## Limitations

- **First prompt idle time**: The very first prompt has no idle time measurement since there's no prior agent completion to measure from.
- **Abrupt termination**: If the process is killed (SIGKILL, power loss), the `session_end` summary won't be written. Stats will recompute totals from individual events in this case.
